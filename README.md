# Ticketbox: A Vue app for a ticket-buying website

This is project to learn the basics of Vue. The code follows the 'Learn Vue.js' course on Codecademy, and is split into three lessons: 'Vue Data', 'Vue Forms' and 'Styling Elements with Vue'.

## Vue Data
In this lesson, we learned four different techniques for displaying and updating dynamic data in our Vue apps. Hereâ€™s a brief recap of the Vue app options object properties we covered and the use cases for each.

-`data` - used for storing known dynamic values
-`computed` - used for computing dynamic values based on known dynamic values - can additionally specify a setter by specifying get and set functions - the setter will update other dynamic values when the computed value changes
-`watch` - used for performing functionality when a specified dynamic value changes
-`methods` - used for storing instance methods to be used throughout the app
